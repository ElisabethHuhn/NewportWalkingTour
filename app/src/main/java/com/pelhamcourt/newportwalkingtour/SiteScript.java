The goal of this tour is to highlight some of this history and highlight the colonial architecture on display within a short distance of the Pelham Court Hotel. Along the way we'll touch on some of the tidbits and stories that make up the rich fabric of pre-revolution Newport.$Newport has over 300 colonial structures. Some of which were built in their current positions, but most were moved here from around the island. Newporters were actually quite adept at moving buildings not only in colonial times but even into today.\n\n For Example: In 1981 a house was moved from the 5th ward several blocks to near Wellington Ave. \n\nThis tour will point out many of the characteristics of colonial architecture. That way you'll be able to recognize the plethora of colonial buildings as you continue your stay in Newport.\n\n This tour will point out many of the characteristics of colonial architecture. That way you'll be able to recognize the plethora of colonial buildings as you continue your stay in Newport.\n\nNewport history was perfect for preserving this rich history. Colonial Newport was a wealthy town. The Rhode Island hinterlands were of sufficient size to support the thriving trade through Newport Harbor. But the British blockaded Newport during the occupation of 1776-1779, shutting down all trade. After the revolution, most commerce had moved to Providence. Now the small size of the colony proved to be to Newport's disadvantage. Most people wanted to ship through ports of their own state. And Rhode Island was too small to support two large ports. In the mid 1800s the inner harbor or cove was filled in to provide the Railroad with land. Newport slipped into a recession that lasted from the end of the Revolution until the 1970's. Then things felt like they got worse. Nixon pulled the fleet out of the Naval District that Newport was a part of in retaliation against Massachusetts voting against him in the 1972 election. Although RI voted for Nixon, they were in the same Naval District as the only state that voted against Nixon. However, what initially felt like disaster turned into the renaissance that produced the thriving Newport you see today.\n\nThe 200 year depressed economy also resulted in families hanging onto and passing down heirlooms. Colonial Newport was famous for its furniture manufacture. Colonial artifacts were passed down in the family instead of being sold as antiques or even museum items.\n\nFamily names that appear in the colonial record appear in class lists of current elementary school students\n\n\nSo, let's start out.",
            "1$S$41.4863685$-71.3143051$Pelham Court Hotel$This is the starting point of the tour. $While not colonial, 14 Pelham Street has architectural features that make it right at home in colonial Newport. The roof style is called mansard. And the little doodads along the roofline are called dentals.",
            "2$n$41.48628$-71.31467$Gas Lit Pelham Street$First gas lit street in the world. David Melville lived at the corner of Thames and Pelham street at the turn of the century from the 1700s to the 1800s. He conducted experiments with gas lighting in his basement. Success was measured by brightness, his lamps were significantly brighter than candles and oil lamps. By 1806 he could light 20 rooms in his home and also had a large lantern to light Pelham street. On March 24, 1810 David Melville was granted the first American gas light patent.$Notice the gas lights along Pelham Street.  While it's not colonial history, Pelham Street is notable for being the first street in the world to be lit with gas. Previously, many cities in the world (notably London) required homeowners to light a torch outside their house, but this was a tremendously inadequate way to provide street lighting. David Melville lived at the corner of Thames and Pelham street at the turn of the century from the 1700s to the 1800s. He conducted experiments with gas lighting in his basement. Success was measured by brightness, his lamps were significantly brighter than candles and oil lamps. By 1806 he could light 20 rooms in his home and also had a large lantern to light Pelham street. On March 24, 1810 David Melville was granted the first American gas light patent. Melville's method of producing gas involved burning coal and wood, but unfortunately due to a fire in the patent office his patent with the details of his method have been lost. Although David Melville was the first, he was never able to make a commercial success of his invention. Even so, he at least lived long enough to see the founding of Newport Gas Light Company in 1836. Whether this filled him with pride or with envy I don't know.",
            "3$n$41.48633$-71.31489$Thames Street$Newporters pronounce it THames (not tems).$In Newport, Thames is pronounced with the TH (THames), and not in the British fashion (tems) for historical reasons. It is the 'King's English'. King George III was German, and did not pronounce the English TH. Thus, the British pronunciation of the London Street changed with the king's pronunciation. However, we in Newport took issue with the crown long about then, and retained the full TH pronunciation of the street name.  Thus, today native Newportians speak of THames Street.",
            "4$n$41.48680$-71.31494$Early History - Banishment$Newport was founded in 1638 by a band of 300 refugees led by Anne Hutchinson that had been banished from the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony. The reason for their banishment, The Antinomian or Free Grace Controversy, is almost incomprehensible to us today. The crux of the problem was whether 'good works' SHOWED that one was of God's chosen, or whether one performed 'good works' to BECOME chosen. Because Anne disagreed vocally with the powers that be, she and her followers were banished to the wilderness. $Anne Hutchinson was a rarity for her time in that she was an educated woman. She believed in a COVENANT OF GRACE.  Redemption was God's gift to his elect and could not be earned by human effort. She accused the ministers (other than her favorites John Cotton and her brother in law John Wheelwright) of preaching a COVENANT OF WORKS whereby people could get into heaven by performing good works. Anne's views became popular because of the idea that one's outward behaviour was not necessarily tied to the state of one's soul.\n\nFrankly, I suspect that Anne's true transgression was that she formed two discussion groups where the parishioners could dissect the week's sermons, one group on Sunday for all, and one on Wednesdays for women only. My guess is that the woman only group was the most suspect. However, Anne also came to espouse 'direct revelation' from God, equal to the scriptures. This challenged the control structures of the church, so I'm sure it added to Anne's troubles. /n\nIn any case, the conflict between Anne, her followers, and the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colonys powers that be escalated to the point of banishment. \n\nAnne, her husband, her 13 children, and 300 like minded colonists left the colony, which only consisted of 800 at the time. The fact that 300 others chose to join Anne in her banishment is a testament to her, and to the strength of the entire assembly's beliefs and shows the magnitude of the theological rift.  \n\nAs there were no jails, banishment to the wilderness was the only punishment available for crimes of this magnitude. Even though the English felt like they were banished into wilderness, this was hardly the case. Indigenous people had occupied Aquidneck for at least 5,000 years. Historically, there was a large summer settlement where downtown Newport sits today. These indigenous people had established sophisticated land management and fishing practices. \n\nBefore leaving Boston, the Hutchinson supporters signed a compact in March 1638 agreeing to form a government based on the individual consent of the inhabitants. They elected Coddington 'Judge' which roughly equated to Governor of the new group.",
            "5$n$41.48694$-71.3149$Early History - Portsmouth $Roger Williams, who had likewise been banished earlier, suggested they purchase Aquidneck Island from the indians, and settle there. They took his advice and in early 1638 they settled in Pocasset at the top northern end of Aquidneck Island. They soon renamed the area Portsmouth,$Roger Williams had suffered like banishment a couple of years earlier, and Anne Hutchinson's band sought guidance from him about where to go. Williams suggested they purchase Aquidneck Island from the indians, and settle there. In early 1638 they settled in Pocasset at the top northern end of Aquidneck Island and soon renamed the area Portsmouth. The Indian name remains part of the community even today. \n\nIn 1639 there was a further split within the group. Wm Hutchinson (Anne's husband) took over the group in Portsmouth, and a significant number of others moved south to Newport. The split soon healed as in 1640 the two towns reunited. However, this friction would soon show up again in the effort to get a royal charter from Britain. Among the members of the group who founded Newport were: Nicholas Easton, William Coddington, John Coggeshall, John Clarke, William Brenton, William Dyer, Thomas Hazard, Henry Bull and Jeremy Clerke, many of whom later became governors of the colony, and most are remembered today in street names and other landmarks.\n\nThis group of banished colonists were very conscious that among their responsibilities of a new life, they were founding a new government. You can read the minutes of their initial meetings in Portsmouth and Newport archived in the Newport Library even today. Liberty of conscience and religion were essential to this group, and they were embodied in the Newport Town Statutes of 1641. Its no surprise these values would show up again in the Rhode Island Charter of 1663.",
            "6$n$41.48692$-71.31476$Early History Anne Hutchinson $Anne Hutchinson herself left Aqudneck Island in 1642 after the death of her husband. She moved south to New Nederlands.$Anne Hutchinson was central to the founding of Newport and Aquidneck Island, but William Hutchenson died in 1642 and without him Anne feared the proximity of Massachusetts. She moved the family still living with her (some of her 13 children stayed behind) south to the New Netherland region, right near where the Throgs Neck bridge is today. Unfortunately, New Amsterdam was not a safe haven. She and all but her youngest daughter were killed in an indian raid in 1643 during one of the earliest Indian uprisings. She had had good relations with the local Indians. So when asked to put up her dogs up so a band of young indian men could come and drink from her well, she tragically complied. Only her youngest daughter escaped to run to the nearest homestead and spread the alarm. Even so, the name Hutchinson remained important in colonial history. For example, the Massachusetts royal governor in 1776 was a descendant of one of the children who did not accompany her south. ",
            "7$n$41.48703$-71.31459$Indian Raid$The guide wires of an unsightly smoke stack were vandalized in 1976, making way for this park.$In 1976 as Newport was being revitalized after the Navy pulled out, the city wanted to beautify the area and build this park in front of Trinity church. Especially since the queen was coming to celebrate the bicentennial in July. Unfortunately, there was a large, unsightly smoke stack from Egan's laundry in front of Trinity Church. The smokestack was not currently in use and the laundry bankrupt, but the Egan family had a restraining order preventing the demolition of the building.\n\nOne night a band of 'Indians' in full war paint and regalia, some looking remarkably similar to prominent Newport citizens, staged a 'raid' and the guidewires to the stack were cut. Due to the danger, the stack was pulled down before the queen's visit.",
            "8$n$41.48689$-71.31445$Colonial Architecture $The number of bays, window caps, clapboards, and roof shape are all elements of colonial architectural style. $The number of bays, window caps, clapboards, and roof shape are all elements of colonial architectural style. Houses can be characterized by the number of 'bays' it has. A bay is a door or a window opening. Thus a house with a center door and a window on either side has three bays. Houses would start out with 3 bays, a door with two windows. The home would be laid out with a central chimney. As the family grew larger and richer, two window bays would be added onto the opposite side of the house, usually with another chimney",
            "9$n$41.48694$-71.31434$22 Mill Street $22 Mill Street is not strictly colonial as it was built in 1860. However, it is in the colonial style. It contains more frills than its neighbors. $22 Mill Street is a 5 bay plan layout, and has elaborate window caps, a quoin at the corners, and dormers on the roof.",
            "10$n$41.48692$-71.31415$24 Mill Street $24 Mill Street was built in 1796. It is a fine example of a five bay plan colonial home. $Notice the plain window caps andn door are plain. The elaborate door frame shows a palladian flair. The dentals above the door is a bit of architectural fluff dearly beloved by the house wrights of the day.  Its roof is hip on gable, which just means that there is a central point with 4 slopes coming off it. ",
            "11$n$41.4868$-71.31399$15 Mill Street $15 Mill Street is also not strictly colonial, being built in 1800. But stylistically, this 5 by home is definitely colonial. $This house shows signs of its growth. In this case, the right side of the house (as you are facing it) was probably the original. The left side of the house was probably added later to accommodate larger families and better finances. The roof is a gable, which just means that it is triangular and slopes in two directions from a central high point. Notice the corner features. While a quoin (pronounced coin)  is often structurally required on a stone building, Newporters tended to include them on wooden ones as decorative elements.",
            "12$n$41.48677$-71.31384$Old Number 1 Fire Station $Newport Fire Station Number 1 housed a horse drawn fire truck. When the city turned to motorized fire trucks, the new fire engines were not strong enough to pull the engines up Mill Street, so Old Number One was closed.$This is not colonial, but Newport Fire Station Number 1 is at 19 Mill Street. This beautiful brick building housed a horse drawn fire truck. At the time, all the fire trucks in Newport were horse drawn. When the city turned to motorized fire trucks, they faces a double dilemma. First, the new fire engines were not strong enough to pull the engines up Mill Street, so Old Number One was closed. Also, in an effort to maximize city resources, all the fire horses were given to the sanitation department to pull garbage trucks. Apparently it was not as essential to update garbage trucks as fire engines. However, the concept of unintended consequences struck. Fire Horses were not nags, but highly trained members of the fire department. Every time the fire sirens went off, every garbage truck in the city turned up at the fire.",
            "13$n$41.48689$-71.31388$26 Mill Street $Across Mill Street #26  is a 4 bay main house with a 4 bay extension on the left side of the home.$26  Mill Streets  window caps, clapboards, and door all mark it as colonial. The roof is gambrel, which although it slopes in two directions from the center, it has an extra plane in the slope. \n\nAll of these homes on Mill Street so far have a front entrance which extend out into the sidewalk. This is often the case in Newport, but as we shall see not always.",
            "14$n$41.48674$-71.31343$37 Mill Street $Further uphill at 37 Mill Street is the Billings Coggshall House from 1748 and is a nice example of colonial architecture. $John Coggshall was from the original founding group from Mass Bay Colony that moved down from Pocasset/Portsmouth. John Coggshall was part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's government, and had voted to acquit Anne Hutchinson at her 1637 trial. Because of his vote, Coggshall was forced to join the group leaving when she was banished. Coggshall was a governor of the four towns in 1647. Unfortunately, he died within a year of becoming governor. Even So, his name comes down to us in several places of Newport Municipal life",
            "15$n$41.48672$-71.31324$41 Mill Street $41 Mill Street is a good example of a gambrel roofed colonial which turns it side to the street rather than its front.$The practice of turning the side of the home to the street often goes unnoticed, but it occures frequently in Newport. ",
            "16$n$41.48682$-71.31283$166 Spring Street$A colonial home with several colonial features. Notice in particular the front stairs.$166 Spring Street is the brown house on the far side of the street at the corner. It is a wonderful example of a simple half house that never expanded beyond the three over two with an interior chimney. The main thing you should notice is the front entry staircase. It does not extend onto the sidewalk, rather it extends into the interior of the home.\n\nYou will see this feature on many of Newport's colonial homes. And it is a direct result of the British soldiers being quartered in Newport Homes during the occupation of 1776-8.  The lads would on occasion have too much to drink, and on the way home (or anywhere else for that matter) would trip over steps that extended onto the sidewalk. Thus the citizenry were ordered to remove their front steps. Many used temporary ladders, but the solution was often to pull the whole staircase into the interior space of the home. 166 Spring is an excellent example.",
            "17$n$41.48707$-71.31283$158 Spring Street$Good example of colonial building that has had the first floor turned into a store. Also note the mansard roof with widows walk. $One last stop before we get to Trinity Church. Colonial buildings have been through many changes since built. 156 Spring Street is a good example of a building that has had its first floor altered into a commercial enterprise. Also note its mansard roof with its wrought iron decoration. The mansard roof is another typical colonial feature.",
            "18$n$41.48727$-71.31295$Trinity Church$Gathered 1698, built 1726, enlarged 1764, restored 1986. The only church in America under the crown of England. Take a close look at the weather vane.$In 1662, after the end of the Civil War and Charles II was restored to the crown,  parliament decided that religious observances must be centered on the Anglican Church, and so passed the Act of Uniformity. The Book of Common Prayer became compulsory. As is so often the case when religion is legislated, 2000 clergy refused and were expelled from the church. The Act also required membership in the Church of England as a prerequisite for holding Royal Office. \n\nBecause of the Act of Uniformity the Anglican Church reigned supreme in most other colonies. However, because of Rhode Island's charter including a 'lively experiment' in religious freedom, the Anglican Church was one among many. Evenso, Trinity church was a large, important congregation in Newport.\n\nIt is the only church in America under the crown of England today. The steeple's weather vane has a crown. There is also a crown on the organ donated by Bishop Berkeley in 1731 inside.\n\nThe Trinity congregation was gathered in 1698 and its first church was built in 1700.   In 1701 Trinity petitioned to the London Society for the propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts for a resident missionary minister. James Honyman served in Newport from 1704 until 1750. \n\nHonyman Hall, (built in 1956 to the south on Trinity grounds, in a consistent architectural style) is named after James Honyman.\n\nThe congregation rapidly outgrew the 1700 building. In 1724, that first building was dismantled, sold, and moved across Narragansett bay. As we shall see, moving buildings was common in colonial Newport, and continues until this day.\n\nFacts about Richard Munday:\n\nO Richard Munday, house wright, was hired to build a new structure. \n\nO Although Richard Munday is referred to as a Designer and an Architect today, he referred to himself as a 'house wright'. \n\nO Munday is one of the several influential architects responsible for the look of colonial Newport.\n\nO We'll see more of Richard Munday's work in Washington Square in the Colony House.\n\nO Munday was heavily influenced by Christopher Wren, who rebuilt 52 of London's churches after the great fire of 1666. We can see Christopher Wren's influence on Munday in the design of Trinity. Trinity also closely resembles Boston's Old North Church, which was built in 1723, the year before Trinity was started.\n\n\nThe congregation continued to grow, and the 1726 structure was enlarged in 1764. The structure was cut apart, the front part moved out, and two new bays inserted. Another example of the expert house movers in Newport.",
            "19$n$41.48736$-71.31295$Bishop Berkley$Bishop Berkeley (bark-lee) was the man who first proposed, 'if a tree falls in the forest with no one around to hear it, does it make a noise'. He spent three years in Newport, and Trinity was his congregation. He donated the organ with the crown of England visible today.  Even though he pronounced it 'Bar-klee', the college in California is named after him. He didn't become a bishop until after he left Newport, but even here everyone refers to him as Bishop Berkeley.$Berkeley wanted to found a liberal arts and sciences college in Bermuda. He had a warrant from King George I and a promise of funds from Parliament, so he sailed to the New World to prepare.  He came to Newport in 1729 with his wife and several others who were to teach at the college. \n\nHe bought almost 100 acres of farmland in Middletown to produce resources for the proposed college. He named it Whitehall. Berkeley's letters mention the diversity of religious thinking in Newportfour sorts of Anabaptists, besides Presbyterians, Quakers, and many of no profession at all. Notwithstanding so many differences, here are fewer quarrels about religion than elsewhere, the people living peaceably with their neighbors, whatever their persuasion. They all agree on one point, that the Church of England is the second best.'\n\nFrom the moment he arrived, he had a strong connection to Trinity. The story goes that Parson Honyman was preaching when a pilot came into the church and announced the arrival of Berkeley. The excitement was so high, that the entire congregation, including Parson Honyman, decamped to the wharf to welcome Berkeley.\n\nIn 1731, Berkeley gave Trinity its organ. The case of the organ is decorated with the Crown of England, Queen Anne's crown.  The first organist was the son of the composer Johann Pachelbel.",

Note the gambrel roof and the decorative dentals.$Newport s are masters at converting colonial buildings for commercial use, and have done so from the earliest times. We will see the Pitts Head Tavern and the White Horse Tavern which were both modified from structures which were originally homes. Also the Newport furnature craftsmen over on the were masters at blending home, workshop, and store. 138 Spring Street is a good example of modifications.",
            "23$n$41.48759$-71.31301$137 Spring Street$This building has been modified for commercial usage by lifting it up a story and slide in a new first floor. Note the dentals, corner treatment, and widows walk.$This technique of lifting a building up and sliding in commercial space was used in colonial times, and throughout the history of Newport. If you look sharply, you will see plenty of examples of this happening to a building. ",

            "26$n$41.48853$-71.3133$Vernan House$The lodgings of Rochambeau after his arrival in Newport and before he sailed to Yorktown. Beautiful example of rusticated wood exterior. Notice there is no coyne, thus the building can not be made of stone. $Vernon House is where Rochambeau, the commander of the French Forces, stayed after the French Fleet arrived in 1780. Notice this 'stone' building is in fact built of wood. As magnificent as the illusion is, you can tell that it is wood and not stone because the corners of the building do not have a quoin (pronounced coin), an absolute requirement of a stone building. The rusticated wood is not the original building style. It was added sometime in the 1750's to a building that was built around 1700. So while not original, it was the look when Rochambeau was here. \n\nIn the 1980's people were spending an absolute fortune to restore an authentic look with rusticated wood to buildings that were obviously not rusticated to begin with. We will see a couple more examples later in the tour.",
            "27$n$41.48881$-71.31346$Clarke Street$Clarke Street is named after John Clarke who drafted the 1663 Royal Charter that enshrined the lively experiment of religious freedom. As you walk along the street, notice the fine examples of colonial buildings.$Clarke Street is named after John Clarke, who was among the original settlers of Newport. He spent over a decade back in England working on the colony's business, and working to obtain a Royal Charter. Although his name is not generally known, he is one of the people most responsible for the religious freedom we experience in America today. \n\nEven though Anne Hutchinson's group (with Coddington as Judge) had purchased the land from the Indians in March 1638, the colony decided that  they needed a royal charter from Britain in order to protect its territorial integrity from the other English colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut. It took over 20 years and three different grants from Britain, but the final 1663 charter lasted unchanged for 180 years. And even then the 1843 State Constitution only changed the number of state officials and their terms. The basic liberties remained intact through today. \n\nEven though John Clarke himself founded the first Baptist church in America (which remains a viable congregation in Newport today), the 1663 Royal Charter that Clarke drafted enshrines the lively experiment of religious freedom (including freedom from religion) in The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The charter stipulated that as long as you are peaceful, you can believe anything you want, according to your own conscience.  Revolutionary stuff. And it drove Massachusetts nuts.\n\nNotice the fine examples of colonial architecture as you walk along the street. ",

            "29$n$41.48946$-71.31363$11 Clarke Street$Note that this building has shingles rather than clapboards.$Before it was called Washington Square, colonists called it the central town square The Parade. \n\nThis colonial house at 11 Clarke Street is interesting in that it has shake shingles rather than clapboards. The shingle style is uniquely American, and is particularly a New England style. Even though this style was present in colonial times, it became particularly popular as a New England style, and most particularly a New England Coastal style, later in the 1800s.",
            "30$Y$41.48943$-71.31194$Touro Synagogue$Although a bit of a detour from the walking tour, the Touro Synagogue is a gem worth seeing if you have the time and energy.   Touro Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in America.$The first Jewish residents arrived in Newport as early as 1658. They were of Spanish and Portuguese origin by way of Amsterdam, London to Brazil through the Caribbean. The long path shows that they must have been overjoyed at the climate of religious freedom that existed in the colony.\n\nBy 1759 the congregation commissioned Peter Harrison to design and build a synagogue. Harrison had already established his reputation with the completion of the Redwood Library and the building of the Brick Market. The current synagogue building was erected in 1763 and is a delightful example of Palladian architecture. It is said to be the oldest synagogue in America. One of the early Rabbi's was Isaac Touro, who gave his name to both the synagogue and the street. \n\nDuring the British occupation of 1776-1779 the synagogue became a hospital for the British military and a public assembly hall. Even though the synagogue was not raided for firewood during the occupation, the congregation was adversely affected for a century. The British occupation was accompanied by closing the port to commerce. As much of the congregation were merchants, many if not most of the Jewish residents fled Newport.  The port closure resulted in the center of Rhode Island commerce moving to Providence.  Even after the occupation ended, Rhode Island was just too small to support two ports. Newport never regained its stature as a leading seaport. The congregation never recovered. By the early 1800s, the synagogue closed for regular services, but opened as needed for funerals, high holidays services and special occasions. The cemetery was still used and maintained throughout. It wasn't until the 1880s that a 'new' community petitioned to reopen the synagogue for regular services. While Touro Synagogue is today a tourist destination, it remains an active house of worship.",

Seat of RI legislature from 1739 to 1901. Later served as county court house.$Originally on this spot was a smaller wooden courthouse built about 1687. The current structure was designed and built in 1741 by Richard Munday, who designed Trinity. Munday was heavily influenced by Sir Christopher Wren (who designed 52 churches in London after the great fire of 1666). The design of the Colony House is derived from the English Georgian style popularized by Wren, but its floor plan follows the customary layout of English town or guild halls, characterized by an open marketplace on the ground floor and civic offices on the second floor.  Newport originally developed in a rather haphazard fashion. But a movement to bring formal town planning included constructing Colony House. They wanted to transform the Parade into a more elegant public space.\n\nMunday died before the Colony house was completed in 1739, and his wife had to petitioned the colonial legislature for payment.\n\nMany important events associated with the shaping of the United States occurred at the Colony House.\n\nIn 1761, the death of George II and the ascension of George III was announced from the balcony.\n\nIn 1764, the inaugural board meeting of the Corporation of the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island, which became Brown University, took place in the building.\n\n In 1766, citizens of Newport celebrated the repeal of the Stamp Act in and around the Colony House. The houses of three prominent supporters of the Act were damaged in the riots that resulted.\n\nAmong them the Wanton Lyman Hazard House that we'll see soon.\n\nIn January and May of 1773, the building served as the meeting site of the Commission of Inquiry into the burning of the British revenue schooner Gaspee by Patriots. In 1772 a ship of the Royal Navy was burned off present-day Warwick by colonists resisting the enforcement of the Navigation Acts.\n\nThe Royal Commission of Inquiry into the incident was convened at Colony House the following year.\n\nAlthough it could have sent any suspects to London to face trial before an Admiralty court, a provision which greatly concerned most colonists, it found insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone.\n\nIn 1774 the colony's General Assembly ordered that weapons be stored in Colony House in preparation for war.\n\nOn July 20, 1776, Major John Handy read the Declaration of Independence from the front steps.\n\nFrom 1776 to 1779 Colony House was used as a barracks during the British occupation of Newport, .\n\nAfter liberating Newport from the British, the French used the building as a hospital.\n\nIt is often said that a French chaplain celebrated the first public Roman Catholic mass in Rhode Island in the Colony House, although there is no physical evidence of that.\n\nIn 1781 the Great Hall on the first floor was the location of a banquet given by General Rochambeau to honor George Washington.\n\nA portrait of Washington, painted by Rhode Island native Gilbert Stuart, hangs in the first floor.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the Colony House was used in May of each year for 'Lection Day' festivities.\n\nOn this day, the results of the Rhode Island April elections were announced, the General Assembly convened ceremonially, and officials were inaugurated.\n\nVisitors from all over Rhode Island came to Newport to participate in victory celebrations, political negotiations, and party conflicts.\n\nNewporters considered it a more important holiday than Christmas.\n\nThe tradition ended in 1900\n\nFrom 1739 (when it was completed) until 1901 (when the new state house in Providence opened) Colony House served as the primary state house of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations\n\nIn September of 1842, delegates met at Colony House to draft a new constitution to replace the 1663 Royal Charter drafted by John Clarke.\n\nThe new Constitution passed 7024 to 51\n\nExpanded the vote to include African-Americans, becoming the first state to do so\n\nAny points they gained with African-American suffrage, they lost by requiring  $134 from naturalized citizens before they could vote\n\nFrom 1901 to 1926 the building served as the Newport County Courthouse.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1932, the building was restored by architect Norman Isham, who simultaneously worked on two other nearby colonial buildings: The Brick Market and the Wanton-Lyman-Hazard House.\n\nIn 1962, the building was designated a National Historic Landmark.",

Parts of this structure date to the 1600s.$ Wanton Lyman Hazard House, built ca. 1697 for Steven Mumford, a relative of John Mumford who made the oldest map of Newport in 1713. The house is the oldest surviving dwelling in Newport. It is located at the corner of Broadway and Stone Street. At the time of the stamp act riot in 1766 it was owned by  Martin Howard, Jr. who was a loyalist and wrote a pamphlet criticizing his fellow citizens for their disregard of Royal and Parliamentary authority.  Consequently, Howard was hanged in effigy and his home vandalized. Howard fled, and his home was auctioned off later that year to the first name on the house, John Wanton, a prosperous Quaker.  Wanton's two daughters married Lyman and Hazard, the other names on the house. The home remained in the family until the 20th century. Unfortunately, the home was uninhabited for a while, and needed restoration when the Newport Historical Society purchased it. It was restored by the same architect who worked on Colony House. ",

The occupation left an indelible mark still visible in Newport today. Every tree but one had been cut down for firewood. 500 buildings were dismantled for firewood. Commerce came to a standstill. After the occupation, Newport never regained its stature as a leading seaport. Newport began its revival in the mid1800s with the arrival of the wealthy families summering in the mansions on Bellevue, but did not truly recover until the 1970s.$The British occupied Newport from 1776 to 1779 with roughly 6500 troops. At least half of the citizenry had left town before the arrival of the British troops, dropping the population from 9,000 to less than 5,000. Even the town newspaper, the Newport Mercury had moved to Attleboro Massachusetts. British General Henry Clinton walked in largely unopposed to a largely vacant city. Many of those who stayed were loyalists, and they looked forward to the promise of renewed trade with the Empire.\n\nUnfortunately, the British occupied Newport with a heavy hand. In addition to taking over the public buildings, e.g. turning Colony House into a barracks, soldiers were quartered in individual homes of the city. By the time they left because of pressure from the French, the town was in ruins. In need of firewood for cooking and warmth during the particularly harsh winters (remember Valley Forge was at this time), the British dismantled about five hundred houses, cut down all but one tree, and destroyed most of the wharves. Those citizens who did not collaborate with the occupying forces further suffered routine plunder and extortion. Overcrowding led to disease. Conditions deteriorated, and hearts and minds turned against the British. By the time the British left, they left behind very few loyalists.\n\nThe first major drive of the French in the Revolution was the attempt to retake Newport. Although the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778 did not succeed, when the British left in 1779, the French under Rochambeau took over and stayed until 1781, when they left to rondeview with Washington in Yorktown.\n\nThe occupation left an indelible mark still visible in Newport today. Not the least of which are the homes whose entry stairways have been pulled in off the street so that inebriated soldiers would not trip on their way back to quarters in private homes.  Much of the population that fled Newport never returned. The books were gone from the Redwood Library. Business could not function during the occupation, and many commercial buildings were destroyed. Before the Revolution, Newport was the fourth largest town in the colonies. After the occupation, commerce had largely moved to Providence, which became the principal port of the state.   Rhode Island was too small to support two large ports. Newport never regained its stature as a leading seaport. Newport was thrown into a recession, that didn't start to lift until the mid 1800s when the wealthy started summering here. Even then, the Cove was filled in for land for the Railroad. Arguably, Newport did not recover until the renaissance of the 1970s caused by Nixon pulling the Navy out and tourism became a driving force. ",

There was a story in the Newport Mercury about a jail break where the prisoner was so disdainful of the conditions of the jail that he left a note behind after a jailbreak disdaining the poor conditions of the building that allowed him to escape.$The initial jail was initially built in 1658, and replaced in 1772. Jails were notoriously inadequate in colonial times, as exampled by Anne Hutchinson and her gang being exiled. Jails were expensive, had to be heated in the cold winters, and prisoners had to be fed. So the structures were not necessarily built to last. There was one story in the Newport Mercury recounting a story about the jailer discovering that not only had his prisoner escaped, he left a note behind ridiculing the poor condition of the Jail.\n\nIn the late 1800s the jail was renovated, and facilities added to house the Newport Police. In 1986 a new police headquarters was built, and the facility that had been the site of the jail since colonial times was turned into a hotel.",

The Quakers were a dominant community in colonial Newport, and over half the inhabitants of Newport were members of the Society of Friends. $The Friends Meeting House is one of the few buildings in Newport dating from prior to 1700, although just barely, it dates from 1699. In the early 1700s the Quaker Meeting House was the largest and most recognizable building in Newport. It was expanded in 1705 and again in 1729. \n\nThe Quakers were a dominant element of society from the founding of the congregation in 1657 well into statehood. One big reason was due to the intolerance of Quakers by other colonies, notably Massachusetts. By 1700 well over half of Newport's population were Quaker.\n\nThe Quaker influence was felt in most aspects of life in Rhode Island. In 1673 Rhode Island passed the first conscientious objector law in America, which excused citizens from participation in the military if their religious beliefs forbade it. Quaker pacifist ideals encouraged neutrality and peace as policies toward Native Americans. Even so, Rhode Island was touched by King Philip's War.\n\nEven though the importance of the Quakers in Newport declined after the Revolution, they continued to have yearly meetings of all New England Quakers. To accommodate these yearly meetings the Meeting House was enlarged in 1807, 1857, and 1867.",

            "41$Y$41.49215$-71.31344$King Philips War$The only reason this marker is here is the proximity of the Friends Meeting House. Metacomet was a Wampanoag chief, who took the English name Philip, and who waged the first Indian war against the Europeans in North America. His home base was Mount Hope off the north end of the Island. \n\nThe European population explosion put pressure on the Wampanoags, who were also feeling pressure from the Iroquois in the west. Tensions built until 1675 when war broke out. Things did not end for Philip. He was captured and killed in 1676. The connection to the Quakers was that their pacifist ideals included neutrality and peace toward Native Americans. $King Philip was the adopted English name of the Wampanoag chief Metacomet. He was the second son of Massasoit, who was chief of the Wampanoag when the Plymouth colony celebrated its Thanksgiving feast. Metacomet became chief in 1662 when his older brother died. The Wampanoag initially lived in harmony with the English, but when the European population continued to grow, coupled with pressure from the Iroquois Confederation to the west, tensions grew. Metacomet was forced to give concessions to the English, and acknowledge that they were subject to English law. Tensions built into war in 1675-6. Initially the indians did great damage to many colonial towns, including Warwick and Providence. But the English greatly outnumbered the Indians. The inevitable occurred. King Philip was killed near Mt. Hope, which is just off the top end of Aquidneck Island, in 1676, ending the first of unfortunately many North American Indian wars to come. ",
