      <name>Pelham Court Hotel</name>
      <description>This is the starting point of the tour. While not colonial, 14 Pelham Street has architectural features that make it right at home in colonial Newport. The roof style is called mansard. And the little doodads along the roofline are called dentals.</description>

      <name>Gas Lit Street</name>
      <description>First gas lit street in the world. David Melville lived at the corner of Thames and Pelham street at the turn of the century from the 1700s to the 1800s. He conducted experiments with gas lighting in his basement. Success was measured by brightness, his lamps were significantly brighter than candles and oil lamps. By 1806 he could light 20 rooms in his home and also had a large lantern to light Pelham street. On March 24, 1810 David Melville was granted the first American gas light patent.</description>

      <description>In 1638 a band of 300 followed Anne Hutchinson, her husband, and 13 children into banishment from the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony, which at the time only numbered 800. This banishment was the result of the disagreement over whether whether “good works” SHOWED that one was of God’s chosen, or whether one performed “good works” to BECOME chosen.</description>

In 1638 they settled in Pocasset at the north of the island, renaming it Portsmouth. In 1639 part of the group split and came to  Newport. By 1640 the split was healed, and the towns reunited.

      <description>Even though Anne Hutchinson was central to the founding of Newport and Aquidneck Island, she did not stay long. William Hutchenson died in 1642 and without him Anne feared the proximity of Massachusetts. She moved her family south to the New Netherland region, right near where the Throgs Neck bridge is today. Unfortunately, she and all but her youngest daughter were killed in an indian raid in 1643 during one of the earliest Indian uprisings. </description>

      <name>Fire House #1</name>
      <description>The first fire house in Newport. Again, this is not colonial, but Newport Fire Station Number 1 is at 19 Mill Street. This beautiful brick building housed a horse drawn fire truck. At the time, all the fire trucks in Newport were horse drawn. When the city turned to motorized fire trucks, they faces a double dilemma. First, the new fire engines were not strong enough to pull the engines up Mill Street, so Old Number One was closed. Also, in an effort to maximize city resources, all the fire horses were given to the sanitation department to pull garbage trucks. Apparently it was not as essential to update garbage trucks as fire engines. However, the concept of unintended consequences struck. Fire Horses were not nags, but highly trained members of the fire department. Every time the fire sirens went off, every garbage truck in the city turned up at the fire.

His home base was Mount Hope off the north end of the Island. The European population explosion put pressure on the Wampanoags, who were also feeling pressure from the Iroquois in the west. Tensions built until 1675 when war broke out. Things did not end for Philip. He was captured and killed in 1676. The connection to the Quakers was that their pacifist ideals included neutrality and peace toward Native Americans. </description>

      <description><![CDATA[Looking North from this corner you will see the Point. Quaker merchants lived in this area of town. Perhaps most noticeable is the names of the streets. While other parts of town enshrine the early settlers of Newport, on the point NS streets are numbered (1st at the water, proceeding to 2nd and 3rd as you proceed west). EW streets are named after trees: Elm, Popular, Willow, Walnut, etc. The quakers thought that naming streets after people was "Man Worship"  rather than glory to God. However, after the revolution, 1st was renamed after George Washington.]]></description>
